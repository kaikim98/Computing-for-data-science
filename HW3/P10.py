Practical programming Chapter 9 Exercise 9

**Instruction**
You are given two integers, start_i and end_i(start_i < end_i)
Complete P10 function to return a list that contains all integers in the range start_i to end_i(inclusive)
in ascending order

P10(33, 49)
>>> [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]

P10(-10, -7)
>>> [-10, -9, -8, -7]

P10(10, 11)
>>> [10, 11]
