"""
**Instruction**
Write P4 function that reads a file and creates another file with different delimeter.
- Assume the input file is delimited with blank(' ').
- Output file has comma(',') as a delimeter
- Assume there is no consecutive blanks in input file. i.e. '  ', '   ', '    ',...  does not appear in the input file.
- Filenames of input and ouput file are entered as input of P4 function
- there is no return value of P4 function
For example, if the input file has below lines, 

beryllium 4 9.012
magnesium 12 24.305
calcium 20 20.078
strontium 38 87.62
barium 56 137.327
radium 88 226

output file should look like this.
beryllium,4,9.012
magnesium,12,24.305
calcium,20,20.078
strontium,38,87.62
barium,56,137.327
radium,88,226
